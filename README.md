## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Kelly
I'm a passionate Software Engineer who recently graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio.
I majored in Computer Science with a Concentration in Software Engineering.
I like doing projects to learn and just recently started uploading them on GitHub as I am applying for jobs!
